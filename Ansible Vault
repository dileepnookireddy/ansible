Ansible Vault is a feature in Ansible that allows you to encrypt sensitive data, like passwords, API tokens, SSH keys, etc., so that it can be safely stored in version control systems like Git.

🔐 Encrypt a File:
--------------
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml     ###You'll be prompted to set a password to encrypt the file.

🔓 Decrypt a File:
-----------------
ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml

📝 Edit an Encrypted File
--------------------------
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml     ###This will decrypt, open in editor, and re-encrypt when saved.

📄 View Encrypted File Contents
-------------------------------
ansible-vault view secrets.yml

🗝️ Using Vault in a Playbook
-----------------------------
If your playbook or variables reference encrypted files, use: 
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
Or use a vault password file: 
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt

🔑 Encrypting Variables Inside Files
-------------------------------------
You can encrypt only certain variables:
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'SuperSecretPassword' --name 'db_password'
##Output example:
db_password: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          6237356339333438653363646436373735636439343037353765336633623834

⚙️ Common Use Cases
✅ Storing sensitive vars (passwords, tokens, keys).
✅ Securing inventory files with sensitive data.
✅ Keeping secrets safe in Git repositories.

------------------------------------------------------
Great! Let’s go through a real-world Ansible Vault example step-by-step — encrypting secrets for a DevOps deployment (like storing a database password securely).
------------------------------------------------------
✅ Step-by-Step: Ansible Vault Example
🎯 Goal:
We'll create an encrypted secrets file with a database password, and use it in an Ansible playbook.

🔹 Step 1: Create and Encrypt the Secrets File
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
It will ask for a password to encrypt the file.

Now edit it securely:
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml

Add content like:
db_user: admin
db_password: myS3cretPassw0rd

When you save & exit, it gets encrypted.

🔹 Step 2: Example Playbook Using Vault
Create a playbook called deploy.yml:

---
- name: Example playbook using Ansible Vault secrets
  hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Show DB Credentials (Demo Purpose)
      debug:
        msg: "Connecting to DB with user '{{ db_user }}' and password '{{ db_password }}'"

🔹 Step 3: Run the Playbook (With Vault Password)
To run the playbook and decrypt secrets:

ansible-playbook deploy.yml --ask-vault-pass

Or use a vault password file for automation:

ansible-playbook deploy.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt

🔹 Step 4: Example Output
TASK [Show DB Credentials (Demo Purpose)] 
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "Connecting to DB with user 'admin' and password 'myS3cretPassw0rd'"
}

🧠 Best Practices
Never hardcode sensitive data in playbooks.
Use --vault-password-file for automation in CI/CD.
Store secrets encrypted in Git safely.
